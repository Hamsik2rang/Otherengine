# Configurations

Otherengine supports configuration using json files.

Files here in the Game/Engine/Config directory are defaults and **SHOULD NOT BE MODIFIED**. You can add or overwrite configurations by creating new files in the Game/Config folder.

The file extension must be .json, and the file name indicates the name of the configuration.
